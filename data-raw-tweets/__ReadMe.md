# Readme for `data-raw-tweets/`

When new tweets are grabbed, they are dropped here in step #1.

Subsequent steps will combine them together and put the results in `data-summary/`.

If we're augmenting a set of tweets collected earlier, add in the latest `data-summary/all_tweets.csv` file so we have the tweets collected in the past.
